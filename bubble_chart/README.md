This project summarizes data from class discussions using d3.  You can run index.html in a browser.  It is also hosted
at robertclaus.github.io.

data.csv provides an example data file.

You can load any csv in the right format using the following url format:
https://robertclaus.github.io/?<Your CSV link>

For example:
https://robertclaus.github.io/?https://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/Vis/CS765-2018-DC2-ExampleData/09-carved-binary-8-0.csv

Most logic is in script.js.

The visualizations do not show a lot of detail, but instead provide high level overviews for how uniform various
features were.

For instance, you can group by user to see if any users posted considerably less than other users.  Since grades for
specific assignments already give the strong discrete details for class performance, these visualizations are intended
to provide broader overviews and isolate outliers.
